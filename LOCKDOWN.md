# Sages Stone Systems — LOCKED STATE

This repository has entered a locked, Tupperware-tight state.

## Rules
- Runtime contracts are immutable.
- Systems define WHAT, never HOW.
- Execution lives exclusively in runtime engines.
- Any change requires version bump + justification.

## Guarantees
- Structural completeness
- Package integrity
- Predictable system boundaries

This lock exists to preserve meaning, not restrict creativity.
