# Observer Interface System

## Purpose
The Observer Interface System defines how observation occurs without granting control,
authority, or causal influence.

It separates *seeing* from *touching*.

## Core Invariants
- Observation is passive.
- Observation does not imply endorsement.
- Observation must not alter observed state.

## Observation Rules
- No feedback loops from observation alone
- No elevation of observer to actor
- No inference of intent from visibility

## Prohibitions
- Observers may not modify state
- Observation may not trigger execution
- Visibility may not be treated as permission

## Scope Limits
This system does not:
- Define observers
- Control access
- Interpret observations

It only defines the interface boundary between system and witness.
