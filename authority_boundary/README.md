# Authority Boundary System

## Purpose
The Authority Boundary System defines who or what is permitted to decide, modify, or terminate state.
It prevents illegitimate escalation and unearned control.

## Core Invariants
- Authority must be explicitly granted.
- Authority is contextual, not absolute.
- Authority expires when context dissolves.

## Boundary Rules
- No implicit authority transfer
- No authority inheritance without declaration
- No authority amplification through observation alone

## Prohibitions
- Systems may not self-authorize
- Power must not be inferred from capability
- Control must not arise from proximity

## Scope Limits
This system does not:
- Assign authority
- Enforce authority
- Resolve authority conflicts

It only defines where authority *ends*.
