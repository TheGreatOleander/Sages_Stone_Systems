# Energy System

The **Energy System** provides canonical reasoning primitives for
understanding energy, power, work, and transformation.

## Purpose
This system supports:
- Energy flow analysis
- Conceptual and physical reasoning
- System-level energy descriptions

## Canonical Status
✅ Canonical  
✅ Repo-aligned  
✅ No placeholders  
✅ No runtime coupling  

## Invariants
Energy is treated as conserved within defined boundaries, and all
analysis is descriptive rather than controlling.

## Philosophy
Energy is modeled as a property of systems and relationships,
not as an independently acting agent.
