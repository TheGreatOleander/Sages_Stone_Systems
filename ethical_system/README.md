# Ethical System

The **Ethical System** provides canonical reasoning primitives for
analyzing values, norms, and moral trade-offs.

## Purpose
This system supports:
- Ethical evaluation of actions and decisions
- Value identification and comparison
- Explicit modeling of moral trade-offs

## Canonical Status
✅ Canonical  
✅ Repo-aligned  
✅ No placeholders  
✅ Advisory-only  

## Invariants
Ethical reasoning is pluralistic, non-authoritative, and explicit
about uncertainty and trade-offs.

## Philosophy
Ethics is treated as structured reflection on values,
not as a source of commands.
