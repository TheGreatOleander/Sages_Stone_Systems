# Contract System (Gold Standard)

This system defines, validates, and executes contracts within Sages Stone.

## Invariants
- All contracts must declare authority, intent, and explicit action terms.
- Contracts are immutable once created.
- Invalid contracts fail fast with named violations.

## Flow
schema -> rules -> executor

This system is the canonical reference for all future systems.
