# Sages_Stone_Systems

This directory contains the formal system-level descriptions that comprise
**Sage’s Stone**.

Each subdirectory represents a distinct conceptual system. These systems are
not implementations. They do not execute, simulate, or perform actions.
They exist to describe invariant structures, constraints, and boundaries
that must hold across domains.

The purpose of this layer is to provide a stable, non-operational map of
reality domains that can be reasoned about without invoking behavior.

---

## Design Principles

- Systems are **descriptive**, not prescriptive
- No system defines procedures, algorithms, or workflows
- No system depends on another system for meaning
- No system anticipates execution or runtime interpretation

Descriptions must remain timeless, deterministic, and context-free.

---

## Directory Structure

- One system per directory
- Each system directory contains only documents that describe:
  - Scope
  - Invariants
  - Constraints
  - Definitions

There are no shared utilities, helpers, or cross-system references.

---

## Authority

All contents of this directory submit to:

1. **LAW**
2. The **Gate**
3. The **System Charter**

If a conflict exists, the higher authority prevails.

---

## Modification Policy

- Changes are made deliberately and one file at a time
- All changes must pass the Gate before being applied
- Ambiguity is treated as error
- Cleanup after the fact is not permitted

---

## What This Is Not

This directory is not:

- A runtime
- A simulation
- A modeling engine
- A framework
- An API
- A decision system

Any interpretation that enables action without Gate mediation
is a violation.

---

## Final Note

If you are looking for execution, behavior, or outcomes,
you are in the wrong layer.

This layer exists to ensure that when action occurs elsewhere,
it is constrained by something that cannot act.
