# Sages_Stone_Systems

This directory contains the formal system-level descriptions that comprise
**Sage’s Stone**.

Each subdirectory represents a distinct conceptual system. These systems are
not implementations. They do not execute, simulate, or perform actions.
They exist to describe invariant structures, constraints, and boundaries
that must hold across domains.

The purpose of this layer is to provide a stable, non-operational map of
reality domains that can be reasoned about without invoking behavior.

Descriptions here remain authoritative only in as far as factum — grounded in what is formally specified, not in how they might later be executed.

## Design Principles

- Systems are **descriptive**, not prescriptive
- No system defines procedures, algorithms, or workflows
- No system depends on another system for meaning
- No system anticipates execution or runtime interpretation

Descriptions must remain timeless, deterministic, and context-free.
