# Null Constraint System

## Purpose
The Null Constraint System defines the conditions under which *nothing* is the only valid action.
It formalizes absence, non-action, and intentional void as first-class system states.

## Core Invariants
- Null is not failure.
- Null is not ignorance.
- Null is a deliberate, stable condition.

## Constraints
- No system may infer intent from null.
- No system may treat null as a placeholder for future action.
- Null cannot be overridden by optimization, urgency, or completeness pressures.

## Prohibitions
- Null must never trigger execution.
- Null must never be auto-resolved.
- Null must never be interpreted probabilistically.

## Scope Limits
This system does not:
- Explain why null occurs
- Resolve null into action
- Evaluate null as good or bad

Null simply *is*.
