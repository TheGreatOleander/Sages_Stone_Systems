# medicine_system

## Purpose
This system defines a canonical truth domain within Sages Stone.

## Inputs
- Explicit, schema-validated structures only.

## Outputs
- Deterministic declarations or judgments.

## Invariants
- No execution
- No mutation
- No hidden context

## Failure Modes
- SchemaViolation
- InvariantBreach
- AuthorityError

## Canonical Status
This system is considered canonical once invariants are satisfied
and runtime contracts recognize it as immutable.
