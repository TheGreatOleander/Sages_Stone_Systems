# Sages Stone Systems – Orientation

This archive is a **systems workspace**, not a single repo.
It contains layered components that can be used independently or together.

## High‑level layers
- **Pre_Sages_Stone** – conceptual / experimental space
- **Sages_Stone** – core abstractions and rules
- **Sages_Stone_Runtime** – executable runtime and enforcement layer

## Build philosophy
- Additive, not destructive
- One file or system at a time
- Full‑file drops (no diffs)
- Zips are treated as transport, not source of truth

This file exists only to help new stewards (human or AI) get oriented fast.
