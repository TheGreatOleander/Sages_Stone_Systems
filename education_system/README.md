# Education System

The **Education System** is a canonical Sage's Stone system responsible for
learning-oriented reasoning and instructional support.

## Purpose
This system provides reusable educational primitives for:
- Explaining concepts at variable depth
- Designing lessons and curricula
- Supporting tutoring and guided learning
- Performing lightweight assessment

## Canonical Status
✅ Canonical  
✅ Fully implemented  
✅ No placeholders  
✅ Composable with other systems

## Core Capabilities
- Adaptive explanations
- Lesson plan generation
- Curriculum design
- Qualitative assessment
- Metadata introspection

## Usage
The Education system is intended to be orchestrated by higher-level
reasoning or runtime systems, not used as a standalone UI component.

## Philosophy
Education is treated as a structured transfer of understanding,
not merely information delivery.
