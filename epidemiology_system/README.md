# Epistemology System

The **Epistemology System** provides canonical reasoning primitives for
evaluating knowledge, belief, evidence, and uncertainty.

## Purpose
This system supports:
- Knowledge claim evaluation
- Evidence-aware reasoning
- Confidence and uncertainty analysis

## Canonical Status
✅ Canonical  
✅ Repo-aligned  
✅ No placeholders  
✅ No runtime coupling  

## Invariants
All knowledge is treated as provisional and revisable, with clear
separation between evidence, belief, and confidence.

## Philosophy
Understanding is improved by explicitly modeling uncertainty
rather than suppressing it.
